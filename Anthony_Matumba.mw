A member of the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]], he serves on the party's Central Command Team, its highest decision-making structure. He is a former [[Makhado Local Municipality]] councillor.

==Political career==
Matumba is a member of the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] (EFF) party. In 2016, he was elected as a councillor for the EFF in the [[Makhado Local Municipality]] in [[Limpopo]]. He was elected as an additional member of the EFF's Central Command Team structure, the party's highest decision-making structure between congresses, at the EFF's elective conference in December 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cele|first=S’thembile|title=EFF elects 40-member central command team|url=https://www.news24.com/citypress/news/eff-elects-40-member-central-command-team-20191215|access-date=2022-01-28|website=Citypress|language=en-US}}</ref>

In July 2020, an investigation by the Digital Forensic Lab (DFRLab) linked the race-baiting Tracy Zille [[Twitter]] account used to spread disparaging and racist content and to harass black women to Matumba.<ref>{{Cite web|title=EFF central command team member linked to race-baiting Tracy Zille account|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/eff-central-command-team-member-linked-to-race-baiting-tracy-zille-account-50799868|access-date=2022-01-28|website=www.iol.co.za|language=en}}</ref> It was also revealed that Matumba was receiving an income from making the hateful comments on Twitter through companies he owned and registered to which Twitter users were directed. Matumba has denied being in charge of the Twitter account.<ref>{{Cite web|title=#TracyZille outed as front for EFF-aligned local government official — Lies, he says|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2020-07-10-tracyzille-outed-as-front-for-eff-aligned-local-government-official-lies-he-says/|access-date=2022-01-28|website=TimesLIVE|language=en-ZA}}</ref> The [[South African Human Rights Commission]] (SAHRC) then took Matumba to the Equality Court after it received a complaint from a member of the public. The case was heard in court on 27 July 2021,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2021-07-27-eff-councillor-in-court-over-racist-tracy-zille-tweets/|title=EFF councillor in court over racist 'Tracy Zille' tweets|access-date=2022-01-28|website=TimesLIVE|language=en-ZA}}</ref> and was postponed to August 2021 on 29 July.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Case against EFF councillor allegedly behind controversial @TracyZille account postponed|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2021-07-29-case-against-eff-councillor-allegedly-behind-controversial-tracyzille-account-postponed/|access-date=2022-01-28|website=TimesLIVE|language=en-ZA}}</ref>
