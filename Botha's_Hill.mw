'''Botha's Hill''' is a small town outside [[Hillcrest, KwaZulu Natala|Hillcrest]] in [[KwaZulu Natala]], [[Afrika Borwa]]. It is the gateway to the Valley of a Thousand Hills. Kearsney College moved to Botha's Hill in 1939.

The village is 37km north-west of [[Durban]], on the old main road to [[Pietermaritzburg]] before the N3 highway was built. It was named after a settler, Philip Rudolph Botha, grandfather of General Louis Botha (1862-1919), first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa.<ref name=dsapn>{{cite web|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names (Public Domain)|url=https://archive.org/details/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames|publisher=Human Science Research Council|page=91}}</ref>
