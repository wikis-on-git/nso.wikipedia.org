'''Cowies Hill''' is a small upmarket residential suburb of [[Pinetown]] in [[Durban]], [[Afrika Borwa]]. Its eponymous hill is a major feature in the Comrades Marathon which is held between Durban and [[Pietermaritzburg]] every year.

Cowies Hill was originally established as farm land and was inhabited by the mayor of Pinetown and his family due to its position overlooking Pinetown. It is situated approximately 15&nbsp;km off the coast line.

Cowies Hill was the site of a farm known as Buffelskop (Buffalo Head) owned by William Cowie in the latter part of the 19th-century.
