'''Harding''' ke toropo wa [[Mmušôgaê wa uMuziwabantu]] go feta [[Mmasepala Setereke tša Ugu]] ka moka [[Afrika Borwa]].

Harding was established as a military outpost following the British annexation of East Griqualand in 1874. Named after Sir Walter Harding (1812-1874) who in 1858 became the first Chief Justice in Natal.

Timber and dairy farming are the main economic activities. The abandoned 122 km narrow gauge Alfred County Railway used to serve the farming areas, linking Harding with Port Shepstone. Harding lies at the foot of the Ingeli Range, 34 km north-west of [[Izingolweni]] and 84 km north-west of [[Port Shepstone]].
