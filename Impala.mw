The '''impala''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|m|ˈ|p|ɑː|l|ə|,_|-|ˈ|p|æ|l|ə}}, ''Aepyceros melampus'') is a medium-sized [[antelope]] found in [[East Africa|eastern]] and [[southern Africa]]. The only extant member of the [[genus]] ''Aepyceros'' and tribe Aepycerotini, it was first [[scientific description|described]] to European audiences by German zoologist [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] in 1812. Two [[subspecies]] are recognised—the common impala, and the larger and darker black-faced impala. The impala reaches {{cvt|70|–|92|cm}} at the shoulder and weighs {{cvt|40|–|76|kg|lb}}. It features a glossy, reddish brown [[coat (animal)|coat]]. The male's slender, [[lyre]]-shaped [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] are {{cvt|45|–|92|cm}} long.

Active mainly [[diurnality|during the day]], the impala may be [[gregarious]] or [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] depending upon the climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-[[predation|predator]] strategy. [[Browsing (herbivory)|Browsers]] as well as grazers, impala feed on [[monocot]]s, [[dicot]]s, [[forb]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[Acacieae|acacia]] pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] takes place toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]], and the victorious male courts female in [[oestrus]]. [[Gestation]] lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are [[lactation|suckled]] for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.

The impala is found in woodlands and sometimes on the interface ([[ecotone]]) between woodlands and [[savanna]]hs; it inhabits places near water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern [[Wildlife of Angola|Angola]] and [[Kaokoland]] in northwestern [[Wildlife of Namibia|Namibia]], the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in [[Wildlife of Gabon|Gabon]] and southern Africa. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) classifies the impala as a [[least concern|species of least concern]]; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a [[vulnerable species]], with fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.

==Etymology==
The first attested English name, in 1802, was palla or pallah, from the [[Tswana language|Tswana]] ''{{lang|tn|phala}}'' 'red antelope';<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, March 2005, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/136375 ''s.v.'' ''pallah'']</ref> the name ''impala'', also spelled ''impalla'' or ''mpala'', is first attested in 1875.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' Supp., 1933, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/92056 ''s.v.'']</ref> Its [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] name, ''{{lang|af|rooibok}}'' 'red buck', is also sometimes used in English.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, November 2010, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/167268 ''s.v.'']</ref>

The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific]] [[generic name (biology)|generic name]] ''Aepyceros'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘high-horned’) comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|{{linktext|αἰπύς}}}} (''{{transl|grc|aipus}}'', 'high, steep') + {{lang|grc|κέρας}} (''{{transl|grc|keras}}'', 'horn');<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Aepyceros|access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1 = Briggs |first1 = M. |last2 = Briggs |first2 = P. |title = The Encyclopedia of World Wildlife |date = 2006 |publisher = Parragon Publishers |location = Somerset, UK |isbn = 978-1-4054-8292-9 |page = 114 |url = {{Google Books|id=LEZfe9Xxm1wC|page=114|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''melampus'' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘black-foot’) from {{lang|grc|μελάς}} (''{{transl|grc|melas}}'', 'black') + {{lang|grc|πούς}} (''{{transl|grc|pous}}'', 'foot').<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Huffman |first1 = B. |title = Impala (''Aepyceros melampus'') |url = http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/aepyceros_melampus.html |website = Ultimate Ungulate |publisher = Ultimate Ungulate |access-date = 10 April 2016 }}</ref>

The impala is the [[monotypic species|sole member]] of the genus ''Aepyceros'' and belongs to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bovidae]]. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by German zoologist [[Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein]] in 1812.<ref name =MSW3>{{MSW3 Artiodactyla | id = 14200488 | pages = 673}}</ref> In 1984, palaeontologist [[Elisabeth Vrba]] opined that the impala is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Alcelaphinae|alcelaphines]], given its resemblance to the [[hartebeest]].<ref name="vrba">{{cite book |last1 = Vrba |first1 = E.S. |editor1-last = Eldredge |editor1-first = N. |editor2-last = Stanley |editor2-first = S.M. |title = Living Fossils |date = 1984 |publisher = Springer |location = New York, USA |isbn = 978-1-4613-8271-3 |chapter = Evolutionary pattern and process in the sister-group Alcelaphini-Aepycerotini (Mammalia: Bovidae) |oclc = 10403493}}</ref> A 1999 [[phylogenetic]] study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris]]) and colleagues, based on [[mtDNA|mitochondrial]] and [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] analyses, showed that the impala forms a [[clade]] with the [[suni]] (''Neotragus moschatus'').

* ''A. m. melampus'' <small>Lichtenstein, 1812</small>: Known as the common impala, it occurs across eastern and southern Africa. The range extends from central [[Wildlife of Kenya|Kenya]] to [[Wildlife of South Africa|South Africa]] and westward into southeastern [[Wildlife of Angola|Angola]].

According to Vrba, the impala evolved from an alcelaphine ancestor. She noted that while this ancestor has [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form for at least five million years.<ref name=vrba /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Arctander|first1=P.|last2=Kat|first2=P.W.|last3=Simonsen|first3=B.T.|last4=Siegismund|first4=H.R.|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=T.B.|editor2-last=Wayne|editor2-first=R.K.|title=Molecular Genetic Approaches in Conservation|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-534466-0|pages=399–412|chapter=Population genetics of Kenyan impalas – consequences for conservation|chapter-url={{Google Books|id=QI8sdCHszY0C|page=399|plainurl=yes}} |oclc = 666957480}}</ref> Several [[fossil]] species have been discovered, including ''[[Aepyceros datoadeni|A. datoadeni]]'' from the [[Pliocene]] of [[Ethiopia]].<ref name="Geraads2012">{{cite journal |last1 = Geraads |first1 = D. |last2 = Bobe |first2 = R. |last3 = Reed |first3 = K. |title = Pliocene Bovidae (Mammalia) from the Hadar Formation of Hadar and Ledi-Geraru, Lower Awash, Ethiopia |journal = [[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]] |date = 2012 |volume = 32 |issue = 1 |pages = 180–97 |doi = 10.1080/02724634.2012.632046 |s2cid = 86230742 }}</ref> The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise very similar in all aspects to the latter.

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[File:Impala AdeFrias.jpg|thumbnail|alt=An impala mid-air during a leap|Impala can leap up to {{convert|3|m|ft}}.]]

Individuals maintain distances of {{convert|2.5|-|3|m|ft}} from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar. Female herds vary in size from 6 to 100; herds occupy [[home range]]s of {{convert|80|-|180|ha|acre sqmi}}. The mother–calf bond is weak, and breaks soon after weaning; juveniles leave the herds of their mothers to join other herds.

[[File:Impala-stotting.jpg|thumb|left|An impala [[stotting]]]]
Social behaviour is influenced by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the [[Serengeti National Park]] showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.<ref name=estes />

The impala is an important prey species for several [[carnivore]]s, such as [[cheetah]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[lion]]s. The antelope displays two characteristic leaps{{snds}}it can jump up to {{convert|3|m|ft}}, over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to {{convert|10|m|ft}}; the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours ([[stotting]]) and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators.<ref name=kingdon /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/impala/ |title = Impala: ''Aepyceros melampus'' |publisher = [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |access-date = 6 May 2014}}</ref> At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape the eye of the predator.<ref name=Nowak>{{cite book |last = Nowak |first = R.M. |title = Walker's Mammals of the World |volume= 2 |year = 1999 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press |location = Baltimore, USA |isbn = 978-0-8018-5789-8 |pages = 1194–6 |edition = 6th |oclc = 39045218}}</ref> The most prominent vocalisation is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away.<ref name=estes /> Scent gland secretions identify a territorial male.<ref name="Kingdon1989">{{cite book|last1 = Kingdon |first1 = J. |author-link = Jonathan Kingdon |title = East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa |volume = 3 |date = 1989 |publisher = Academic Press |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-0-226-43725-5 |pages = 462–74 |url = {{Google Books|id=JiHqC9ROZTQC|page=462|plainurl=yes}} |oclc = 48864096}}</ref> Impalas are sedentary; adult and middle-aged males, in particular, can hold their territories for years.<ref name="estes" />

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Aepyceros melampus Impala in Tanzania 3490 Nevit.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A herd in Tanzania|Impala inhabit woodlands.]]
The impala inhabits woodlands due to its preference for shade; it can also be found on the interface (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs. Places near water sources are preferred. In southern Africa, populations tend to be associated with ''[[Colophospermum mopane]]'' and ''Acacia'' woodlands.<ref name=estes /><ref name=Skinner /> Habitat choices differ seasonally{{snds}}''[[Acacia senegal]]'' woodlands are preferred in the wet season, and ''[[Acacia drepanolobium|A. drepanolobium]]'' savannahs in the dry season.

The historical range of the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as [[Wildlife of Burundi|Burundi]]. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern [[Wildlife of Uganda|Uganda]] in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and [[Kaokoland]] in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in [[Wildlife of Gabon|Gabon]] and across southern Africa.<ref name="iucn status 12 November 2021" />

Around a quarter of the common impala populations occur in protected areas, such as the [[Okavango Delta]] ([[Wildlife of Botswana|Botswana]]); [[Masai Mara]] and [[Kajiado]] (Kenya); [[Kruger National Park]] (South Africa); the [[Ruaha National Park|Ruaha]] and [[Serengeti National Park]]s and [[Selous Game Reserve]] ([[Wildlife of Tanzania|Tanzania]]); [[Luangwa Valley]] ([[Wildlife of Zambia|Zambia]]); [[Hwange National Park|Hwange]], [[Sebungwe]] and [[Zambezi Valley]] ([[Wildlife of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]]). The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the [[Etosha National Park]]. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in [[Mkomazi National Park]] (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near [[Lake Kariba]] (Zimbabwe).<ref name="iucn status 12 November 2021" /><ref name="East">{{cite book |last1 = East |first1 = R. |title = African Antelope Database 1998 |date = 1999 |publisher = IUCN Species Survival Commission |location = Gland, Switzerland |isbn = 978-2-8317-0477-7 |pages = 238–41 |url = {{Google Books|id=59Ci3C8BCmEC|page=238|plainurl=yes}} |oclc = 44634423}}</ref>
