'''Ivory Park''' is a densely populated residential area in the east of [[Johannesburg]], in the [[Gauteng]] province of South Africa.

Ivory Park is occupied by more than 182 000 black people and is located in Midrand (the widely held view that it's located in Tembisa is inaccurate) and falls under the City of Johannesburg Municipality. Services in Ivory Park have improved since the early 1990s. It has five clinics, eight schools, a police station, two libraries and is served by the popular Voice of Tembisa FM community radio station.
