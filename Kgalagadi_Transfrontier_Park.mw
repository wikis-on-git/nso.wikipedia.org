==Facilities==
Within the park there are three traditional tourist rest camps. These are fully serviced lodges and include amenities such as air conditioning, shops and swimming pools. There are also six wilderness camps in the park. The wilderness camps provide little more than shelter and wash water; visitors must supply their own food, drinking water and firewood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sanparks.org/parks/kgalagadi/tourism/accommodation.php#wilderness |title=Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park|publisher=SANParks |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>
