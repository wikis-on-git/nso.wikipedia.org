'''Tshiame''' ke toropo wa [[Maluti-a-Phofung Mmusogae]], [[Mmasepala Setereke tša Thabo Mofutsanyana]] go feta diporofense [[Free State]] ka moka [[Afrika Borwa]]. Tshiame e 12&nbsp;km bodikela la [[Harrismith]]le leboa la toropo kgolokgolo, [[Phuthaditjhaba]]. It is named after Tshiame Kenneth Mopeli, Chief Minister of the former [[QwaQwa]] homeland.

The full perimeter of the industrial area is fenced in by modern technology, creating a "see-through wall" of wire mesh standing three metres tall. The fencing-off was done as a security measure, to keep unwanted elements out as a means to curb crime perpetrated in the area.

The settlement borders the N5 national road leading to the [[KwaZulu Natala]] coast, and is situated just north of the Sterkfontein Dam, a major water reservoir and the second largest dam in South Africa.
