The full perimeter of the industrial area is fenced in by modern technology, creating a "see-through wall" of wire mesh standing three metres tall. The fencing-off was done as a security measure, to keep unwanted elements out as a means to curb crime perpetrated in the area.

The settlement borders the [[N5 (South Africa)|N5 national road]] leading to the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] coast, and is situated just north of the [[Sterkfontein Dam]], a major water reservoir and the second largest dam in South Africa.
